# Code

This repo contains the software for our team. This includes the
overall team control, and also the code that translates actions into
motor commands, our motor control.

## TeamControl

TeamControl is a centralised software intended to run on a machine
next to the field, and communicate with all other SSL systems and our
robots.


## MotorControl

This module is intended to be run on a raspi, on each robot, to
receive and translate actions into motor commands.
