# TEAM CONTROLLER

This is where the skills are being used and accessed by the other parts of the module.

# Skills

To impliment a skill, you will need to think about the following:

1) What does your skill do

  e.g. you want to go to a point, so you will need to get the robot moving
  to do that, you will need to have : velocity - vx, vy, w

2) What you will need to do before you start your skills

  So before you can run your skills, you will need to consider : 
    1. Do you need any data ? 
    2. Do you need to calculate anything
    3. Do you need to set anything before that.

3) Think about how you will need to create that data
  - Do you need to have another function to process ? 
  - Do you need to do calculation ? 
  - Do you have all you need, data, are they here already or from world model.

4) What data you will need?
  - Data about the field, you can get them from world model. 
  - Please check for functions to see what data you need / what is currently available.
  - Message on Software channel for any questions.


4) Where / how you wanted the robot to finish.

  at the finish state, you will need to think about whether you want it to do anything else.
  
  This can be setting everything to 0 so it stops moving.
  
  Please Message on Software channel for any questions.
